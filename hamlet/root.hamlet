        Orange Roster is a convenient way to keep up-to-date with your friends' contact information without sacrificing your privacy. No data is ever shared without your explicit instruction. You can safely keep your mailing address, phone number and screen names here without concern of them being publicly available.
    #profile
        %img.icon!src=@StaticR.profile_png@
        Put up information you want your friends to see: phone numbers, addresses, whatever you like.
    #share
        %img.icon!src=@StaticR.arrows_png@
        Share your profile with your friends. Just enter their email address in the share box, and we will take care of the rest. And if they want, they can share right back with you.
    #address-book
        %img.icon!src=@StaticR.address_book_png@
        It's convenient to be able to keep all of your contact information in one place. If your friends put up a profile and share it with you, you can always get their most recent contact information. You can also put up information about them for yourself. Once again, anything goes: favorite color, anniversary or their name in Klingon.
